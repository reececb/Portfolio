                <p>My name is Reece Bryant.  I am a web developer based in Texas.  
                    I have gained interest and developed a passion for work in this field, 
                    which has led me to pursue a career in it.

                <p>This is a project I created while learning Javascript and Jquery.  
                It is an interactive web quiz that provides feedback to user input and keeps track of the userâ€™s score. 
                Below is a link to a live version of this project hosted on Github.</p>
                <p>Built using: Javascript, Jquery, HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p>I first realized that I was interested in technology at age seventeen.  
                    I started researching computer hardware, and decided to build my own.  
                    Since then I have done many builds and I really have a lot of fun with  it as a hobby.  
                    I have always enjoyed  DIY projects and learning how things work.  
                    My journey into coding and web dev did not start until more recently.  
                    My other interests are automobiles, music, and being active outdoors.  
                    I also have two dogs, and absolutely love animals.
